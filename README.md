# A Hierarchical Max-Infinitely Divisible Spatial Model  for Extreme Precipitation

This R package contains the code to simulate from and do MCMC-based inference on the max-infintely divisible spatial model described in the paper listed below. One of the aims of this model is to more flexibly account for weakening spatial dependence at increasingly high tail quantiles -- a property which is not possible with limiting max-stable models.
